## Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

-   **Verification Procedures:** We conduct thorough identity verification for
    new customers using government-issued documents, biometric verification, or
    third-party verification services.
-   **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** For higher-risk clients, we perform
    enhanced due diligence, including the source of funds, to identify potential
    sanctions risks.
-   **Automated Screening Tools:** We screen transactions and parties against
    global sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC) in real-time to prevent unauthorized
    transactions.
-   **Global IP Denylist**: We block IP Addresses from Government affiliated
    entities, as well.
-   **Regular List Updates:** We ensure that our screening tool is updated
    regularly to reflect changes in sanctions lists. We maintain and monitor
    addresses from the
    [Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists)Â of
    the US Office of Foreign Asset Control. We maintain an open source tool that
    automates the update process for new addresses, which can be found here:
