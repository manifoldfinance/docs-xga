title: API Reference
---

API paths to resources are generally broken into multiple segments,

`{scheme}://{host}/{version}/{category}/[{pathSegment}][?{query}]`:

-   `version`: can be v1.0 or beta.
-   `category`: is a logical grouping of APIs into top-level categories.
-   `pathSegment`: is one or many navigation segments that can address an
    entity, collection of entities, property, or operation available for an
    entity.
-   `query`: string must follow the OData standard for query representations

## API Rate Limiting

If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily
according to these guidelines:

Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning
of you, your family, and possibly your entire country.

## Exceeding the rate limit

#### 80 requests per minute is the public default

!!! warning

    Reach out to us via Telegram or Email to get a rate limit increase if needed.

If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a `403` or `429`
response, ~~and the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header will be `0`. You should not
retry your request until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset`
header.~~

If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a `403` or `429` response
and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit.

~~If the `retry-after` response header is present, you should not retry your
request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the
`x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you should not retry your request until
after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset`
header.~~[^1]

[^1]: Response header for retry/rate limit is not yet available.

<!-- @private
- If the `retry-after` response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
- If the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header. The `x-ratelimit-reset` header is in UTC epoch seconds.
- Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

## Checking the status of your rate limit

You can use the headers that are sent with each response to determine the current status of your primary rate limit.

| Header name             | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-ratelimit-limit`     | The maximum number of requests that you can make per hour                    |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window            |
| `x-ratelimit-used`      | The number of requests you have made in the current rate limit window        |
| `x-ratelimit-reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch seconds |
| `x-ratelimit-resource`  | The rate limit resource that the request counted against.                    |

You can also call the `GET /rate_limit` endpoint to check your rate limit. Calling this endpoint does not count against your primary rate limit, but it can count against your secondary rate limit. For more information, see "[REST API endpoints for rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/rate-limit/rate-limit)." When possible, you should use the rate limit response headers instead of calling the API to check your rate limit.

There is not a way to check the status of your secondary rate limit.

## Exceeding the rate limit

If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a `403` or `429` response, and the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header will be `0`. You should not retry your request until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header.

If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a `403` or `429` response and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit. If the `retry-after` response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you should not retry your request until after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header. Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of you, your family, and possibly your entire country.
