## Forward Contracts

### Nature of the Forwards to be sold

The embedded volumetric optionality is primarily intended, at the time that the
parties enter into the agreement, contract, or transaction, to address
constraint factors that influence demand for transaction inclusion rights (i.e.
blockspace). This instrument addresses the potential variability in the supply
of available blockspace available for usage by different actors.

The options refer to slices of the overall gas size of β-blockspace. We aim to
homogenize it, i.e. all slices of gas are equal and interchangeable. This is how
the forward contract is exercised.

The nature of the forwards we are selling under the β-blockspace market depends
on the capacity restriction we impose. Most importantly, do we guarantee enough
capacity that the calls get included or not? The problem with guaranteeing a
fixed capacity for β-blockspace is that this means restricting the capacity for
⍺-blockspace. The problem with this is that ⍺-blockspace might be more lucrative
for us. In particular, we know that lottery blocks come along that make up a
large chunk of the overall remuneration we can achieve at all.

!!! info "Figure 1: Tradeoff of ⍺/β-blockspace"

    If we fix ⍺-blockspace, we might be missing a significant amount of value. The tradeoff can be seen in the picture below.

![tradeoff-⍺-vs-β-blockspace](../assets/images/illustration-tradeoff-alpha-beta.png)

We make the assumption that top of the block gas space is more valuable. The
main assumption is that at some point, the marginal value for a builder owning
the whole block (green) goes below the marginal value of a β-blockspace buyer
(typically someone who wants to be just included independently of the order).

If we had perfect information, we could fix the capacity constraint at exactly
the intersection point. But this information is not available. We can only
approximate it. The question of lottery blocks can also be seen in the diagram,
the question is whether for such a block both curves are shifted in the same
way. If not, it would indicate the need to give ⍺-blockspace builders more space
relative to β-blockspace builders.

<!-- There is another aspect to consider. The larger the ⍺-blockspace part, the
larger the possibility of including a txs in β-blockspace that will revert (due to state changes). This will
degrade the value of the option to buy β-blockspace space. What is more, this might jeopardize the service
as a whole. If builders get the impression that the service is not of sufficient quality, then they
will stop using it. So there is also a reputation component - in particular at the beginning.

### Bidder characteristics

!!! info inline "Assumption of Intrablock Position"

    We operate under the assumption that position does not matter; if it does might affect the design
    significantly.

-   **Bidders are possibly risk-averse**: Standard revenue equivalence might go
    out of the window. Bidders are asymmetric; in particular if there is private
    orderflow.

-   **Bidders valuations are not clear**: If they draw from a public mempool or
    if there are global conditions affecting value of block space, their
    valuations will be interdependent. - There is also the danger of a further
    coordination issue; this might favor a winner-takes-all solution

## Relation to the secondary market

Traditionally we would assume that a well-designed auction does not require a
secondary market. If the result of the auction is in the core, no change in the
allocation makes sense. This is different here as information comes in
overtime. - Base fee - Transactions updates for ⍺-blockspace bidders We operate
under the assumption that position does not matter; if it does might affect the
design significantly.

New bidders are active on the secondary market. The secondary market therefore
is not just a reallocation of the primary auction but includes information
updates.

!!! note "Secondary Market Effects"

    This is in contrast to most work on auctions with resale (re: secondary) markets. The secondary market changes the rationale for bidding in the primary auction
