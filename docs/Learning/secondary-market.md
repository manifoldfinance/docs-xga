## Secondary Market

The structure the secondary market so that a concentrated selling back is
feasible

The main purpose of this market is to account for information differences over
time - builders might realize they cannot fill a block; or they might need more
space The base fee is not known at the time of the primary market; so there
should be updates regarding the base fee happening with before-strike-time
blocks being minted. This also affects the initial pricing we offer.

!!! info inline "Allocation subject to change" It is unclear what allocation we
will have from the primary market, as a winner-takes all is possible
