needed.

## Networking

The main entry for new events is the gossip protocol, which is how consensus
nodes communicates with other consensus nodes.

1. Discovery: our node has a series of known `bootnodes` hardcoded. We request a
   list of the nodes they know about and add them to our list. We save them
   locally and now can use those too to request new nodes.

2. Message propagation. When a proposer sends a new block, or validators attest
   for a new block, they send those to other known nodes. Those, in turn,
   propagate the messages sent to other nodes. This process is repeated until,
   ideally, the whole network receives the messages.

## Gossipsub

One of the main communication protocols is GossipSub. This allows us to tell
peers which topics we're interested in and receive events for them. The main
external events we react to are blocks and attestations.

### Receiving an attestation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant prod as Topic Producer (GenStage)
    participant proc as Topic Processor (Broadway)
    participant FC as Fork-choice store

    prod ->> proc: Produce demand
    proc ->> proc: Decompress and deserialize message
    proc ->>+ proc: on_attestation()
    proc ->> FC: request latest message by the same validator
    FC -->> proc: return
    proc ->> proc: Validate attestation
    proc ->>- FC: Update fork-choice store weights
```

When receiving an attestation, it's processed by the
[on_attestation](https://eth2book.info/capella/annotated-spec/#on_attestation)
callback. We just validate it and send it to the fork choice store to update its
weights and target checkpoints. The attestation is only processed if this
attestation is the latest message by that validator. If there's a newer one, it
should be discarded.

The most relevant piece of the spec here is the
[get_weight](https://eth2book.info/capella/annotated-spec/#get_weight) function,
which is the core of the fork-choice algorithm. In the specs, this function is
called on demand, when calling
[get_head](https://eth2book.info/capella/annotated-spec/#get_head), works with
the store's values, and recalculates them each time.

!!! important

    It is a requirement that the validator cache the weights and the head root each time it adds a block or attestation: so it won't need to do the same calculations again.
    Additionally, it should save the latest messages in persistent storage as well so that if the node crashes it can recover the tree weights.

### Receiving a block

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant prod as Topic Producer (GenStage)
    participant proc as Topic Processor (Broadway)
    participant block as Block DB
    participant state as Beacon States DB
    participant FC as Fork-choice store
    participant exec as Execution Client

    prod ->> proc: Produce demand
    proc ->> proc: Decompress and deserialize message
    proc ->>+ proc: on_block(block)
    proc ->> exec: Validate execution payload
    exec -->> proc: ok
    proc ->> FC: request validation metadata
    FC -->> proc: return
    proc ->> proc: Validate block
    proc ->> block: Save new block
    proc ->> proc: Calculate state transition
    proc ->> state: Save new beacon state metadata
    proc ->> FC: Add a new block to the tree and update weights
    loop
        proc ->>- proc: process_operations
    end
    loop
        proc ->> proc: on_attestation
    end
```

Receiving a block is more complex:

-   The block itself needs to be stored.
-   The state transition needs to be applied, a new beacon state calculated, and
    stored separately.
-   A new node needs to be added to the block tree aside from updating weights.
-   on_attestation needs to be called for each attestation.

Also, there's a more complex case: we can only include a block in the fork tree
if we know of its parents and their connection with our current finalized
checkpoint. If we receive a disconnected node, we'll need to use
Request-Response to ask peers for the missing blocks.
